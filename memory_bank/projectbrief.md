# Project Brief

Project name: GoT â€” Thunder God (working)

High-level overview
This project is a browser-based action game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (ES modules). It presents a top-down / third-person experience where the player controls a thunder-themed hero (GoT) who explores maps, fights enemies, and configures skills/loadout. The UI is modular and built from plain DOM + small utility modules; 3D assets and scenes are available where appropriate.

Core requirements and goals
- Provide a responsive game playable in desktop and mobile browsers.
- UI should be localizable (English/Vi) and support runtime language switching.
- Provide modular skill and map systems: skill pool, loadouts, skillbook, and a map manager with endless generation.
- Keep the codebase simple and dependency-free; use vanilla JS modules and Three.js only where necessary for 3D.
- Persist player state (loadout, uplift choices) in localStorage.
- Make the project easy to run locally (open index.html or use simple static server).
