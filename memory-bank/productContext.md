# Product Context

Purpose
This document explains why the project exists and what it should accomplish. It gives context for product decisions and helps any agent (Cline or a human) understand the problem space.

Why this project exists
- Players want a lightweight, browser-playable action game with quick sessions and accessible controls.
- The project focuses on a clear core loop: explore maps, fight enemies, customize skills/loadout, and progress through increasing difficulty (endless maps).
- Localizability and small-footprint deployment are key â€” the game should run by opening index.html or via a simple static server.

Problems being solved
- Creating a polished browser-native gameplay experience without heavy toolchains or complex build steps.
- Providing modular systems (skills, maps, loadouts, uplift) so new content can be added without major refactors.
- Making the UI and content translatable so the game can reach multiple language audiences.

How the product should work (high-level)
- Player can create a hero, select skills (Q/W/E/R) and a basic loadout, and roam maps generated by a MapManager.
- Maps include a set of base maps and a deterministic endless generator for higher-depth runs.
- Skills are data-driven (SKILL_POOL) and shown in the Skillbook; players assign skills to slots and preview them.
- Player progression: leveling unlocks uplift choices (persisted in localStorage), and maps unlock progressively.
- Combat systems (skills.js, skills_pool.js, entities.js) consume translations and configuration to render localized UI.

Key stakeholders / consumers
- Gameplay engineers implementing skills, maps and enemy scaling.
- UI engineers who render hero screens, skillbook, and settings.
- Localization maintainers who update src/locales/* files.

How to use this file
- Read before making product-level design choices.
- Update when the product goals, target audiences, or major UX flows change.
